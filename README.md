# Create Token
This Solidity program is a "Create a Token" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. 

## Description
Written in Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain, this application is a straightforward contract. 
The contract has a function for making custom tokens.

## Executing Program
To run this application, we can utilize Remix, an online Solidity IDE, which can be found at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Click the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar to compile the code. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another suitable version), and then click OK. then press the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

After compiling the code, you can deploy the contract by selecting the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. 

You can interact with the contract once it has been deployed by first entering a value and then copying the account address. Next, go to the mint function and paste the account address that you copied.

Then, in the mint function, enter a value and then transact. The next step is to check your balance to see how much you have. Finally, repeat the procedure with the mint function by pasting the address and entering a figure for how much you want to withdraw from your current balance. After that, we can put your program to the test.
